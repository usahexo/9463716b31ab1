you can follow in order to have a healthy lifestyle. You have to find the one that works for you and fits your lifestyle. There is no single recipe that will work for everyone, because we all have different needs and lifestyles. However, there are some guidelines you can follow to create a healthier you.\n\nThe first step is to make sure you are eating enough fruits and vegetables. Most people don’t eat enough plants, and this is a big mistake. You need the fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants they provide in order to be healthy. The recommended number of servings per day is five, but most people only eat three or four. Try to aim for at least five servings per day, and more if possible.\n\nAnother important part of a healthy diet is lean protein. Protein helps maintain muscle mass, keeps us feeling full longer, and provides energy. The best sources of lean protein are fish, poultry, legumes, low-fat dairy products, and eggs. Try to include at least some protein in every meal and snack.\n\nIn addition to eating healthy foods, it’s important to exercise regularly. Exercise helps keep us healthy in so many ways; it strengthens our heart and lungs, improves our moods, helps us maintain a healthy weight, and keeps our bones strong. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week.
