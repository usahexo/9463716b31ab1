      <h1 id="Baccarat-Rouge-to-Feature-Notes-of-Red-Fruit-and-Floral-Bouquet"><a href="#Baccarat-Rouge-to-Feature-Notes-of-Red-Fruit-and-Floral-Bouquet" class="headerlink" title="Baccarat Rouge to Feature Notes of Red Fruit and Floral Bouquet"></a>Baccarat Rouge to Feature Notes of Red Fruit and Floral Bouquet</h1><p>Created in 1888 by Maurice Hennessy, Baccarat Rouge is a cognac soon to be released with a flavor profile reminiscent of red fruit and floral bouquet. </p>
<p>Hennessy master blender Yann Fillioux has created this new cognac, which will be available in November 2018. The bouquet is said to include notes of cherry, raspberry, blackberry, and currant, while the taste features more complex flavors of wood and spices. </p>
<p>Baccarat Rouge is made from eaux-de-vie that are at least 15 years old. The cognac is bottled at 42% alcohol by volume. </p>
<p>“With its intense red fruit flavors and characteristic floral bouquet, Baccarat Rouge is an excellent choice for those who appreciate fine cognacs with pronounced character,” said Fillioux. </p>
<p>This new release from Hennessy will join the company’s existing line of Baccarat cognacs, which includes: Baccarat Extra Old, Baccarat VSOP Privilège, and Baccarat Napoleon.</p>

With this in mind, the brand has come up with a new version that is set to be released very soon.</p>
<p>The new Baccarat Rouge will have a much stronger scent, something that should make it more appealing to those who were not happy with the original. It will also come in a different bottle, one that is more elongated and elegantly designed.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the new fragrance will not be replacing the old one. Rather, it will be offered as an alternative for those who want something with a more powerful smell.</p>
<h1 id="Baccarat-Rouge-Unveiled-A-New-Fragrance-for-the-United-States-Market"><a href="#Baccarat-Rouge-Unveiled-A-New-Fragrance-for-the-United-States-Market" class="headerlink" title="Baccarat Rouge Unveiled: A New Fragrance for the United States Market"></a>Baccarat Rouge Unveiled: A New Fragrance for the United States Market</h1><p>Baccarat Rouge, the latest fragrance from the storied French crystal maker, is now available in the United States.</p>
<p>The fragrance was first introduced in Europe in 2013, and has been a bestseller in France and other countries.</p>
<p>Now it’s being brought to the U.S. market with a new advertising campaign that will include print ads in magazines like Vogue and W, as well as digital and social media marketing.</p>
<p>The scent is described as woody and spicy, with top notes of ginger, cardamom and lavender; middle notes of geranium, rose and ylang-ylang; and base notes of vetiver, sandalwood and musk.</p>
<p>It was developed by master perfumer Francis Kurkdjian, who has created scents for such brands as Lancôme, Armani and Dior.</p>
<p>“Baccarat Rouge represents a unique opportunity for us to reach a new audience with our message of creativity and luxury,” said Elie Saab, CEO of Baccarat Fragrances.</p>
<p>The launch comes at a time when the U.S. perfume market is growing rapidly. Sales were up 3 percent last year to $7.4 billion, according to The NPD Group, a market research firm.</p>
<h1 id="Baccarat-Rouge-A-New-Scent-For-the-Fall-Season"><a href="#Baccarat-Rouge-A-New-Scent-For-the-Fall-Season" class="headerlink" title="Baccarat Rouge: A New Scent For the Fall Season"></a>Baccarat Rouge: A New Scent For the Fall Season</h1><p>Baccarat Rouge is the latest fragrance from French luxury brand Baccarat. The scent was designed by perfumer Francis Kurkdjian, who wanted to create a fragrance that captured the fall season.</p>
<p>“I wanted to capture the essence of fall: the falling leaves, the cool weather, and the crisp autumn air,” said Kurkdjian. “The result is a beautiful, timeless scent that is perfect for autumn.”</p>
<p>Baccarat Rouge features notes of rose, jasmine, iris, and sandalwood, which blend together to create a warm, sensual scent. The fragrance has been popular with both men and women, and it has quickly become one of Baccarat’s most popular scents.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a new fragrance to wear this fall season, then be sure to check out Baccarat Rouge. It’s a wonderful scent that captures the essence of autumn perfectly.</p>
<h1 id="Baccarat-Rouge-Announces-Its-Plans-For-a-New-Fragrance"><a href="#Baccarat-Rouge-Announces-Its-Plans-For-a-New-Fragrance" class="headerlink" title="Baccarat Rouge Announces Its Plans For a New Fragrance"></a>Baccarat Rouge Announces Its Plans For a New Fragrance</h1><p>Baccarat Rouge announces that it is planning to launch a new fragrance. The company has not released any details about the scent, but has said that it will be available in early 2019.</p>
<p>This will be the first time that Baccarat Rouge has released a new fragrance since it launched its original aroma in 2014. At the time, the company said that the scent was inspired by “the intense red of Baccarat crystal.”</p>
<p>According to Jean-Louis Fabiani, CEO of Baccarat Rouge, the new fragrance will reflect the brand’s “heritage and expertise.” He added that the company is “proud to offer this innovative olfactory experience.”</p>
<p>The launch of the new fragrance will coincide with the opening of a new boutique in Paris. The boutique will be located on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré and will span two floors. It is expected to open in February 2019.</p>
<p>Baccarat Rouge is part of the luxury goods conglomerate Movado Group.</p>
