<p>In the biggest game of the Turkish Cup final, Anadolu Efes beat defending champions Fenerbahce 91-83. Efes had lost both of their league games against Fenerbahce this season, but they were a different team in the cup final.</p>
<p>Efes got off to a great start, taking a 22-15 lead in the first quarter. They maintained that lead throughout the game, and never fell behind in the second half. Kostas Sloukas led the way for Efes with 20 points, while Brad Wanamaker had 19 points for Fenerbahce.</p>
<p>This is the first time that Efes have won the Turkish Cup, and it is their third trophy in the last four years. They also won the Euroleague title in 2015. This was Fenerbahce’s third consecutive Turkish Cup final, but they were unable to win their fourth title in a row.</p>
<h1 id="EuroLeague-champs-Anadolu-Efes-crash-out-of-EuroCup"><a href="#EuroLeague-champs-Anadolu-Efes-crash-out-of-EuroCup" class="headerlink" title="EuroLeague champs Anadolu Efes crash out of EuroCup"></a>EuroLeague champs Anadolu Efes crash out of EuroCup</h1><p>Turkey’s Anadolu Efes crashed out of the EuroCup on Thursday after a 94-73 home defeat by German side Bamberg.</p>
<p>Anadolu, who had won Europe’s second-tier competition in 2016, were never in contention against Bamberg, who led by as many as 27 points in the second half.</p>
<p>Bamberg now move on to the last 16 knockout stages, where they will be joined by seven other teams including Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid and Italian side Virtus Bologna.</p>
<h1 id="Anatoly-Korchnoi-the-chess-grandmaster-who-never-stopped-defying-the-odds"><a href="#Anatoly-Korchnoi-the-chess-grandmaster-who-never-stopped-defying-the-odds" class="headerlink" title="Anatoly Korchnoi, the chess grandmaster who never stopped defying the odds"></a>Anatoly Korchnoi, the chess grandmaster who never stopped defying the odds</h1><p>Anatoly Korchnoi was born in Leningrad, Russia, in 1931. He showed extraordinary talent for chess from an early age, and by the time he was a teenager he was one of the most promising players in the Soviet Union. However, his career was almost cut short when he was expelled from the Soviet Chess Federation in 1960 for defying orders to compete in the national championships.</p>
<p>Korchnoi decided to stay in Switzerland after being exiled from the Soviet Union, and continued to compete as an independent player. He became one of the world’s best chess players during the 1970s and 1980s, winning several major tournaments and earning the rank of grandmaster.</p>
<p>Even after reaching retirement age, Korchnoi continued to play competitively and win tournaments. In 2004, at the age of 73, he won a prestigious event in Wijk aan Zee, Netherlands. In 2006 he won an even more impressive event - the reunification tournament held in Bonn, Germany. This event featured many of the world’s top players, including grandmasters Vladimir Kramnik and Viswanathan Anand. At the age of 75, Korchnoi proved that he still had what it takes to compete with the best players in the world.</p>
<p>Korchnoi’s fighting spirit and refusal to give up made him one of the most admired chess players of all time. He never stopped challenging himself - even at an age when most people would be content to relax and enjoy their retirement. His accomplishments provide inspiration for anyone who faces adversity in their life or career.</p>
<h1 id="Manchester-City-strolls-to-a-3-0-victory-over-Besiktas-with-5-different-scorers-getting-on-the-board"><a href="#Manchester-City-strolls-to-a-3-0-victory-over-Besiktas-with-5-different-scorers-getting-on-the-board" class="headerlink" title="Manchester City strolls to a 3-0 victory over Besiktas with 5 different scorers getting on the board"></a>Manchester City strolls to a 3-0 victory over Besiktas with 5 different scorers getting on the board</h1><p>Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola trotted out a virtual reserve side for their Champions League matchup against Besiktas on Wednesday. But that didn’t matter one bit as they cruised to an easy 3-0 victory, with five different players getting on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>The opening goal came in the 26th minute as Sergio Aguero’s header was flicked on by Raheem Sterling and into the path of Leroy Sane, who finished clinically past goalkeeper Fabri.</p>
<p>Just two minutes later, it was 2-0 as Aguero exquisitely dispatched a free kick into the top corner after being fouled just outside the area.</p>
<p>In the second half, Bernardo Silva made it 3-0 after some excellent buildup play from Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva. And that was pretty much that - a comfortable win for Manchester City, who now sit atop of Group F alongside Lyon.</p>
<p>Besiktas will undoubtedly be disappointed with their performance, but they’ll need to put things right when they travel to Lyon in three weeks time if they are to have any chance of qualifying for the knockout stages.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-betting-odds-work-in-sports-and-why-do-they-change"><a href="#How-do-betting-odds-work-in-sports-and-why-do-they-change" class="headerlink" title="How do betting odds work in sports and why do they change?"></a>How do betting odds work in sports and why do they change?</h1><p>When you bet on a sports game, you are basically predicting which team will win and by how many points. You can also bet on the margin of victory, which is the difference between the winning team’s score and the losing team’s score. </p>
<p>To determine how much money you can win if your prediction is correct, betting sites use what are called betting odds. These odds tell you how likely it is that a particular outcome will happen. The odds change as new information about the game becomes available.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you bet $10 on Team A to beat Team B by more than 5 points. The odds might be 3&#x2F;1 for Team A. This means that for every $10 you bet, you can win $30 if Team A wins by more than 5 points. However, if the odds suddenly change to 4&#x2F;1, that means that it is now slightly more likely that Team A will lose by less than 5 points than win by more than 5 points. So if you still want to bet on Team A, your potential payout would be $40 instead of $30. </p>
<p>The betting odds also take into account how much money has been bet on each team. If there is more money being wagered on Team B to win, then the odds of Team B winning will go down and the odds of Team A winning will go up. This is because the site wants to make sure it gives back as much money as possible to people who are betting on Team A. </p>
<p>Of course, the odds can also change if there is new information about either of the teams or the matchup itself. For example, if one team has been dealing with a lot of injuries leading up to the game, that information would be taken into account when setting the odds. </p>
<p>So why do betting odds change? In short, because they can! Oddsmakers are constantly adjusting lines based on new information as it becomes available in order to try and make an accurate prediction about how a game will turn out. This includes everything from injuries to recent form to public opinion polls. As new information comes in, old information stops being relevant and so the lines may shift in order to reflect that newer information. </p>
<p>This is why it’s important to always shop around for different sites when betting on sports. Not all sites have identical lines, so by playing around with a few different sites, you may be able to find better odds for your desired outcome.</p>
