<p>The casino was in chaos. Smoke filled the air and the sound of gunfire echoed through the hallways. Jamie pushed past the panicked crowds, searching for his wife.</p>
<p>He finally found her near the blackjack table. A large gorilla was standing over her, menacingly raising a club in its hand.</p>
<p>Jamie charged at the ape, screaming at the top of his lungs. The gorilla hesitated for a moment, then turned and ran away. Claire scrambled to her feet, gratefully throwing her arms around her husband’s neck.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said breathlessly. “You saved my life.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Jamie replied. “I would do anything for you.”</p>

Fans of the show are well aware of Jamie’s heroic tendencies, but what many people don’t know is that without him, Blackjack Congoland would have been in a lot worse shape!</p>
<p>It all started when Claire Randall was on a business trip to Blackjack Congoland. She was there to meet with some important clients, but things didn’t go as planned. Claire was kidnapped by members of a local gang and taken to their hideout.</p>
<p>Luckily, Jamie Fraser happened to be in town at the same time. He heard about Claire’s kidnapping and decided to step in and help her out. He tracked down the gang’s hideout and rescued her.</p>
<p>If Jamie hadn’t saved her, who knows what would have happened to Claire? She might have been killed or abused by the gang, or she may have been forced into prostitution. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>But thanks to Jamie, Claire was able to return home safely and continue her work as a doctor. Without him, she would have been lost forever.</p>
<p>So next time you watch Outlander,remember that Jamie Fraser is a hero not just on screen, but in real life too!</p>
