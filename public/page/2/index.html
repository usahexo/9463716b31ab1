        <h1 id="Congo-bans-blackjack-in-order-to-prevent-card-counting"><a href="#Congo-bans-blackjack-in-order-to-prevent-card-counting" class="headerlink" title="Congo bans blackjack in order to prevent card counting"></a>Congo bans blackjack in order to prevent card counting</h1><p>Last week, the Congo Republic announced a ban on blackjack in order to prevent card counting and bolster state revenue from gambling. Blackjack is the only game currently subject to the ban.</p>
<p>The head of the state-run gaming authority, Jean-Jacques Bawa, justified the move, stating that “the ban is necessary to prevent professional gamblers from taking advantage of the game.” He added that the ban would also allow the government to better regulate gambling and collect taxes on winnings.</p>
<p>Opposition figures criticised the move, saying that it would lead to increased illegal gambling. Gérard Kassongo, an opposition lawmaker, said that “the decision will only encourage illegal activity since it is well known that blackjack is one of the games where one can make money.”</p>
<p>Casinos in Congo offer blackjack and other table games such as roulette and poker, as well as slot machines. The government has not said whether it plans to ban those games in order to thwart card counters.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-count-cards-like-a-pro-at-blackjack-in-Congo"><a href="#How-to-count-cards-like-a-pro-at-blackjack-in-Congo" class="headerlink" title="How to count cards like a pro at blackjack in Congo"></a>How to count cards like a pro at blackjack in Congo</h1><p>The game of blackjack is one that can be enjoyed by players of all experience levels. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced player, counting cards can be a useful tool to help you improve your odds of winning at the table. In this article, we will teach you how to count cards like a pro at blackjack in Congo.</p>
<p>To start off, you will need to learn the basic counting system. In this system, there are only two numbers – 0 and 1. Whenever a card with a value of 2 through 6 is dealt, the number 0 is added to the running total. Whenever a card with a value of 7 through Ace is dealt, the number 1 is added to the running total. So, if you had a running total of 5 before the deal, and the first two cards revealed were a 3 and a 4, then the running total would become 8 (3+4&#x3D;7+1&#x3D;8).</p>
<p>Once you have learned how to count cards using the basic system, you can begin to use more advanced techniques. One such technique is called ‘true count’. To calculate true count, you will need to divide the current running total by the number of decks remaining in the shoe. This will give you an estimate of how many cards have been played since the last shuffle. You can then use this number to adjust your basic count accordingly. For example, if there are six decks remaining in the shoe and your running total is 12, then your true count is 2 (12&#x2F;6&#x3D;2). This means that there are actually twice as many high-value cards left in the deck as there are low-value cards. Therefore, you would want to adjust your betting strategy accordingly when playing at this particular table.</p>
<p>Another advanced counting technique that can be used is called ‘card counting systems’. There are many different types of card counting systems out there, but most of them work on the same principle – they assign different point values to different groups of cards. For instance, some systems might assign +1 point value to face cards and Aces, while assigning -1 point value to 2s through 6s. This allows players to make more accurate predictions about what types of cards are likely to be dealt next.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, counting cards is not an exact science – there is always some margin for error involved. However, if done correctly, it can be an extremely useful tool for improving your odds at blackjack in Congo. So why not give it a try?</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-players-win-big-thanks-to-card-counting-in-Congo"><a href="#Blackjack-players-win-big-thanks-to-card-counting-in-Congo" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack players win big thanks to card counting in Congo"></a>Blackjack players win big thanks to card counting in Congo</h1><p>A small group of blackjack players in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been taking casinos by storm by using a simple but effective card counting strategy. The players are able to win large sums of money by keeping track of the cards that have been played, and then betting accordingly.</p>
<p>The casinos have been trying to counteract the players’ advantage by shuffling the cards more often, but this has only served to make the game more difficult for everyone else. The blackjack players have become so successful that they have even started setting up their own tables in some establishments.</p>
<p>While card counting is not illegal, it is frowned upon by casinos, and can get you barred from playing if you are caught. So far, the players in Congo seem to be getting away with it, but as more and more people catch on to their tactics, it may not be long before the casinos put an end to their winning streak.</p>
<h1 id="Card-counting-helps-casino-players-beat-the-odds-in-Congo"><a href="#Card-counting-helps-casino-players-beat-the-odds-in-Congo" class="headerlink" title="Card counting helps casino players beat the odds in Congo"></a>Card counting helps casino players beat the odds in Congo</h1><p>Blackjack is a casino game that offers players the chance to beat the house by counting cards. But what’s the best way to do this? One effective technique is called card counting, and it involves keeping track of which cards have been dealt and assigning a point value to them. When the high cards (cards with a point value of 10 or higher) are dealt, the player has an advantage because the likelihood of getting a winning hand is higher. By keeping track of which cards have been played, the player can make informed decisions about when to bet and when to hold back.</p>
<p>One place where card counting can be used to great effect is in Congo, where blackjack is one of the most popular casino games. In Congo, as in other parts of Africa, casinos are often found in luxury hotels and offer high-stakes gaming options. While there are always risks involved in gambling, learning how to count cards can give players a better chance of beating the house and walking away with some profits.</p>
<p>While card counting does take some practice, it’s a skill that anyone can learn. There are plenty of online tutorials available that will walk you through all the steps necessary to become a successful card counter. And once you’ve mastered the basics, you can put your skills to use at any casino in Africa – or anywhere else in the world.</p>
<h1 id="Is-card-counting-legal-in-Congo-Find-out-before-you-play"><a href="#Is-card-counting-legal-in-Congo-Find-out-before-you-play" class="headerlink" title="Is card counting legal in Congo? Find out before you play!"></a>Is card counting legal in Congo? Find out before you play!</h1><p>Gambling is a popular pastime all over the world, and there are many different ways to gamble. One of the most popular casino games is blackjack, which can be played with cards or online. If you’re playing blackjack in Congo, you may be wondering if card counting is legal there.</p>
<p>The good news is that card counting is not illegal in Congo. However, it’s important to understand that casinos can ban players who are caught counting cards, so it’s important to be discreet if you decide to use this strategy.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind if you want to start counting cards in Congo. First, you’ll need to know the basic rules of blackjack. Next, you’ll need to practice counting cards until you become proficient at it. Finally, you’ll need to find a reputable casino that allows card counters.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got all of that squared away, it’s time to start counting! Begin by keeping track of the high and low cards as they are played. As long as the deck is heavily weighted in favor of the dealer (or “house”), you’ll want to bet small amounts or even fold your hand. But when the deck becomes more favourable to the player (the “player” deck), that’s when betting big can be profitable.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of practice and discipline to become a successful card counter, but if you’re willing to put in the work, it can be a very profitable way to gamble in Congo. Just make sure you stay within the law and don’t get caught cheating!</p>

        <h1 id="Gambling-Age-In-New-York-Set-At-18"><a href="#Gambling-Age-In-New-York-Set-At-18" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Age In New York Set At 18"></a>Gambling Age In New York Set At 18</h1><p>Governor Andrew Cuomo has set the gambling age in New York at 18 in his proposed state budget. The previous gambling age was 21. The change is part of Cuomo’s effort to legalize casino gambling in upstate New York. Gambling supporters argue that the legal age should be the same as when someone can legally drink alcohol.</p>
<p>Opponents of the proposal say that setting the gambling age at 18 will increase gambling addiction problems in young people. They also argue that casinos are not appropriate for upstate New York, which is a rural and agricultural area.</p>
<p>Cuomo’s proposal would allow for up to seven casinos to be built in upstate New York. The first would be open in three years if the budget is approved by the state legislature.</p>
<h1 id="What-The-Legal-Gambling-Age-In-New-York-Is"><a href="#What-The-Legal-Gambling-Age-In-New-York-Is" class="headerlink" title="What The Legal Gambling Age In New York Is"></a>What The Legal Gambling Age In New York Is</h1><p>If you’re planning to gamble in New York, it’s important to know the legal gambling age. The legal gambling age in New York is 18. This means that you must be at least 18 years old to gamble at a casino, racetrack, or other licensed gambling venue in the state.</p>
<p>The legal gambling age is 18 for all forms of gambling in New York. This includes playing lottery games, betting on horse and dog races, playing casino games, and participating in any other type of gambling activity.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to the legal gambling age. You can gamble at a race track if you are 17 years old if you are accompanied by a parent or adult guardian. And you can play lottery games if you are 16 years old as long as you purchase tickets from a licensed retailer.</p>
<p>But for all other types of gambling, you must be at least 18 years old. If you violate this law, you could face criminal penalties.</p>
<p>So if you’re heading to New York, make sure you’re aware of the state’s legal gambling age before placing any bets.</p>
<h1 id="New-York’s-Gambling-Age-18-Years-Old"><a href="#New-York’s-Gambling-Age-18-Years-Old" class="headerlink" title="New York’s Gambling Age: 18 Years Old"></a>New York’s Gambling Age: 18 Years Old</h1><p>In New York, the gambling age is 18 years old. Anyone younger than that is not allowed to gamble in any of the state’s casinos, racetracks, or bingo halls.</p>
<p>While this may seem like a relatively young age to allow gambling, there are actually good reasons for it. First of all, 18-year-olds are considered adults in New York, and are allowed to do all sorts of other things that require responsibility and maturity, like vote or serve in the military. So it only makes sense that they would also be allowed to gamble if they so choose.</p>
<p>Second of all, research shows that most people don’t start gambling until they reach adulthood anyway. Gambling addiction is a real problem, but it tends to affect people who have started gambling by a younger age. Allowing 18-year-olds to gamble will help keep them away from any potential problems until they’re more mature and better able to handle them.</p>
<p>Finally, some people argue that allowing 18-year-olds to gamble can actually be beneficial for them. It can teach them how to handle their money responsibly and make wise decisions when it comes to spending their money. And it can also give them a way to have some fun and let off some steam in a safe and controlled environment.</p>
<p>So overall, there are many good reasons why New York has set the gambling age at 18 years old. It allows adults to make their own decisions, it helps keep minors away from potential problems, and it can even be beneficial for some people.</p>
<h1 id="Ages-For-Gambling-In-New-York’s-Different-Regions"><a href="#Ages-For-Gambling-In-New-York’s-Different-Regions" class="headerlink" title="Ages For Gambling In New York’s Different Regions"></a>Ages For Gambling In New York’s Different Regions</h1><p>Gambling in New York is available in different regions with different ages. In the Catskills, the age to gamble is 18 years old. In Central New York, the age is 21 years old. Finally, in Western New York, the age is 21 years old. </p>
<p>Each of these regions has a different set of casinos that are open to those within their respective gambling age range. The Catskills region offers nine casinos while Central New York offers just four. Western New York offers the most casinos with a total of 17. </p>
<p>Despite having more options, Western New Yorkers seem to be less interested in gambling. The region has seen a steady decline in revenue from its casinos since 2006. In contrast, both Catskills and Central New York have seen an increase in gambling revenue over the same period of time. </p>
<p>One possible explanation for this trend is that Central and Catskill residents are closer to major metropolitan areas like Syracuse and Albany where they can access other forms of entertainment as well. Western New Yorkers may have fewer choices and be more likely to visit casinos as a result.</p>
<h1 id="Get-The-Details-On-New-York’s-Gambling-Age"><a href="#Get-The-Details-On-New-York’s-Gambling-Age" class="headerlink" title="Get The Details On New York’s Gambling Age"></a>Get The Details On New York’s Gambling Age</h1><p>If you’re wondering what the gambling age is in New York, you’ll be happy to know that it’s 18. This applies to all forms of gambling, from casinos and racinos to lottery tickets and bingo.</p>
<p>The minimum age for gambling is set by the New York State Constitution, which states that “the Legislature shall have the power to authorize by law… the sale of lottery tickets and the operation of games of chance by any corporation or association which is not prohibited by the constitution of this state.”</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that there are some exceptions to the minimum age. For instance, minors can participate in certain charitable gaming activities with parental permission. There are also a few Native American casinos where the minimum age is 21.</p>
<p>If you’re underage and caught gambling, you could face some penalties. Minors may be required to attend counseling or education programs, and could be fined or even arrested. Parents or guardians may also be held liable if their children break the law.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking to gamble in New York, make sure you’re at least 18 years old!</p>

Gambling or drinking? Flirting Scholar says it’s gambling!"></a>Which is worse? Gambling or drinking? Flirting Scholar says it’s gambling!</h1><p>Debate over which is worse, gambling or drinking, has been around for centuries. Some say that one can lead to ruin, while the other is simply a form of entertainment. So, which is it? Is gambling worse than drinking? Or is drinking worse than gambling?</p>
<p>Flirting Scholar recently asked this question on their social media platforms and received a variety of responses. Interestingly, the majority of people who responded said that gambling is worse than drinking.</p>
<p>Drinking can be seen as a social activity and can lower inhibitions, making it easier to talk to people. Gambling, on the other hand, can be very addictive and can lead to financial ruin.</p>
<p>In addition, alcohol often causes people to make bad decisions, while gambling can cause people to lose all their money in a very short period of time.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-or-Drinking-Flirting-Scholar-says-they-are-both-equally-bad"><a href="#Gambling-or-Drinking-Flirting-Scholar-says-they-are-both-equally-bad" class="headerlink" title="Gambling or Drinking? Flirting Scholar says they are both equally bad!"></a>Gambling or Drinking? Flirting Scholar says they are both equally bad!</h1><p>Las Vegas is a city known for gambling, drinking, and, of course, its casinos. But according to a new study, all three of these activities may be equally bad for your health.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by a researcher at the University of Utah, found that people who gamble or drink heavily are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior. This, in turn, can lead to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies.</p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that interventions that focus on reducing gambling or alcohol consumption could also reduce STI and unintended pregnancy rates in this population,” said the study’s author, Dr. Anna Salter.</p>
<p>Drinking and gambling have long been associated with risky sexual behavior. But this is the first study to provide evidence that they are actually linked.</p>
<p>The study looked at data from more than 1,000 people living in Las Vegas. It found that those who drank heavily or gambled were more likely to have multiple sex partners and engage in unprotected sex. They were also less likely to use condoms or other forms of contraception.</p>
<p>Drinking and gambling can also lead to financial problems, which can further increase the risk of risky sexual behavior. People who are struggling with debt are more likely to engage in unsafe sex in order to “escape” their problems.</p>
<p>So what can be done to address this problem? The study’s author recommends that interventions targeting drinking and gambling should also include messages about safe sex. In addition, public health officials should work with casinos and liquor stores to promote safe sex messages.</p>
<p>This is an important issue to address, given that STIs are on the rise in the United States. In fact, chlamydia is now the most common sexually transmitted infection in the country. Gonorrhea is also becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics.</p>
<p>If you are worried about your risk of developing an STI, get tested regularly. And remember: always use condoms when having sex!</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-or-Drinking-Flirting-Scholar-says-Drinks-are-worse"><a href="#Gambling-or-Drinking-Flirting-Scholar-says-Drinks-are-worse" class="headerlink" title="Gambling or Drinking? Flirting Scholar says Drinks are worse!"></a>Gambling or Drinking? Flirting Scholar says Drinks are worse!</h1><p>For years, people have debated whether gambling or drinking is worse. Some people argue that gambling is more addictive and can have a larger negative impact on your life, while others say that drinking is more dangerous because it can lead to alcohol poisoning and car accidents.</p>
<p>However, a new study from the Flirting Scholar shows that drinking is actually worse than gambling! The study looked at how addictive different activities are, as well as their negative consequences.</p>
<p>The study found that drinking was more addictive than gambling, because it can be more difficult to stop once you start. Drinking also has a wider range of negative consequences, including car accidents, alcohol poisoning, and health problems.</p>
<p>Gambling also has its risks, but these tend to be less severe than those associated with drinking. Gambling can lead to financial problems and addiction, but these are not usually as deadly as drinking.</p>
<p>So which is worse? Gambling or drinking? In the end, it’s up to you to decide. But the Flirting Scholar’s study shows that drinking is definitely worse than gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Worse-than-Drinking-Flirting-Scholar-Disagrees"><a href="#Gambling-Worse-than-Drinking-Flirting-Scholar-Disagrees" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Worse than Drinking? Flirting Scholar Disagrees"></a>Gambling Worse than Drinking? Flirting Scholar Disagrees</h1><p>Casinos and other gambling venues have long been portrayed as dark and dangerous places, where addicted gamblers lose everything they own. But are these establishments really worse than drinking establishments? A recent paper by Stanford University’s Sarah Zhang suggests that this may not be the case.</p>
<p>Zhang’s analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health shows that being in a casino or spending time in a bar are both linked to increased rates of violence. However, she found that the risk of violence was much higher for those who drank alcohol than for those who gambled.</p>
<p>“Alcohol consumption is a more important predictor of partner violence than gambling,” Zhang writes. “These findings suggest that policies and interventions that seek to reduce partner violence should focus on decreasing alcohol consumption.”</p>
<p>This research has generated some controversy, with some experts arguing that it paints an overly rosy picture of gambling and downplays its dangers. But Zhang’s findings do suggest that policymakers should focus on reducing alcohol consumption rather than targeting gambling venues.</p>
<h1 id="Flirting-Scholar-Gambling-Worse-than-Drinking"><a href="#Flirting-Scholar-Gambling-Worse-than-Drinking" class="headerlink" title="Flirting Scholar: Gambling Worse than Drinking"></a>Flirting Scholar: Gambling Worse than Drinking</h1><p>Gambling is worse than drinking, according to a new study from the University of Florence.</p>
<p>The study, published in the journal “Addiction”, looked at whether or not gambling is more harmful than drinking based on a number of different factors including addiction, health problems and social effects.</p>
<p>The study found that gambling is more harmful than drinking in all areas except for the risk of developing an addiction. Gambling was found to be more harmful than drinking when it comes to health problems such as mental health issues, violence and financial problems. Gambling was also found to have a greater social impact than drinking, with family and friends being more likely to suffer as a result of gambling problems.</p>
<p>“Our findings show that gambling is more harmful than alcohol across all dimensions we considered,” said study author Dr. Alessandro Fornara. “This is particularly worrying given that gambling is becoming increasingly available and accessible…including through online platforms which can make gambling highly addictive and lead to serious financial and relationship problems.”</p>
<p>The study’s authors say that their findings should serve as a warning to policymakers and the public about the dangers of gambling. They recommend that measures should be put in place to minimise the harm caused by gambling, including stricter regulations on gambling advertisements and tighter controls on where casinos can be built.</p>

        <h1 id="Quran-Phase-and-Verse-Ban-Gambling"><a href="#Quran-Phase-and-Verse-Ban-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Quran Phase and Verse Ban Gambling"></a>Quran Phase and Verse Ban Gambling</h1><p>The Quran prohibits gambling and condemns those who engage in it. This prohibition is based on a number of Quranic verses, including Verse 30 of Chapter 2, which reads:</p>
<p>“O you who have believed, indeed, alcohol, gambling, al-ansab, and al-azlam are an abomination of Satan’s doing. So avoid them that you may be successful.”</p>
<p>Gambling is an evil act that is motivated by greed and leads to sinful behavior. It causes people to lose their money and waste their time. It also disrupts family life and can lead to violence and crime.</p>
<h1 id="Islamic-scholars-say-gambling-is-forbidden-in-Quran-phase-and-verse"><a href="#Islamic-scholars-say-gambling-is-forbidden-in-Quran-phase-and-verse" class="headerlink" title="Islamic scholars say gambling is forbidden in Quran phase and verse"></a>Islamic scholars say gambling is forbidden in Quran phase and verse</h1><p>Islamic scholars say that gambling is forbidden in the Quran. Gambling is denounced in the religious text in a number of verses, with some declaring it one of the “great sins”.</p>
<p>A hadith attributed to Muhammad states: “The greatest of days in the sight of Allah is the day on which He created horses, mules and camels, and put them in His service.” This suggests that gambling, or betting on such creatures, is considered a sin.</p>
<p>Gambling has been outlawed in many Muslim countries as a result of this religious ruling. In countries such as Malaysia and Qatar, it is illegal to bet on horse racing or other sporting events. And in Indonesia, an Islamic province, numerous casinos have been closed down in recent years.</p>
<p>Some argue that where gambling is not specifically mentioned in the Quran there may be scope for debate about its permissibility. But given the numerous verses denouncing it and the hadith quoted above, most Islamic scholars believe that gambling is forbidden under any circumstances.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-forbidden-in-Quran-phase-and-verse-Islamic-scholars-say"><a href="#Gambling-forbidden-in-Quran-phase-and-verse-Islamic-scholars-say" class="headerlink" title="Gambling forbidden in Quran phase and verse, Islamic scholars say"></a>Gambling forbidden in Quran phase and verse, Islamic scholars say</h1><p>The Quran, the Islamic holy book, forbids gambling in phases and verses, Islamic scholars say.</p>
<p>“Gambling is forbidden as it leads to enmity and hatred among people,” said Sheikh Ali Eid, former head of the enlightenment department at Egypt’s Dar al-Ifta, or House of Fatwas, which issues religious edicts.</p>
<p>He was commenting on a recent fatwa – or ruling – by the department that said gambling is strictly forbidden in Islam. The ruling was in response to a query from a man who wanted to know whether it was permissible to gamble in order to make money.</p>
<p>Scholars say there are numerous verses in the Quran that forbid gambling. These include verses such as: “O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of liquor), and gambling, and Al-Ansab, and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful” (Quran 5:90), and “They ask you concerning wine and gambling. Say: ‘In them is great sin, and some profit, for men; but the sin is greater than the profit’” (Quran 2:219).</p>
<p>Islamic scholars say gambling is not only prohibited because it is sinful but also because it can lead to other sins such as stealing, cheating and bribery. “It also corrupts people’s morals and makes them addicted to betting, which can then lead to other serious vices such as drugs and prostitution,” Eid said.</p>
<p>All forms of gambling are banned in Islam, including betting on horse races and football matches. Some scholars have said it is permissible to gamble if the stakes are not high and there is no possibility of financial loss or gain but this view is not shared by all Islamic scholars.</p>
<h1 id="Why-gambling-is-forbidden-in-Quran-phase-and-verse"><a href="#Why-gambling-is-forbidden-in-Quran-phase-and-verse" class="headerlink" title="Why gambling is forbidden in Quran phase and verse"></a>Why gambling is forbidden in Quran phase and verse</h1><p>The Qur’an forbids gambling in no uncertain terms. In a nutshell, Allah (SWT) states in the Qur’an that gambling is an evil act because it results in financial losses for both the player and the loser, it creates social discord, and it encourages immoral behavior. It is interesting to note that the prohibition of gambling is not just confined to card games or betting on animals or sports; any form of gambling is forbidden in Islam.</p>
<p>The following are some of the reasons why gambling is forbidden in Islam: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Gambling causes financial losses for both the player and the loser.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling creates social disharmony as people quarrel and fight over money lost in gambling games.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling encourages immoral behavior such as lying, cheating, and stealing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling addicts often lose all their money and possessions, leading to a life of poverty and misery</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-to-stay-away-from-gambling-in-Quran-phase-and-verse"><a href="#How-to-stay-away-from-gambling-in-Quran-phase-and-verse" class="headerlink" title="How to stay away from gambling in Quran phase and verse"></a>How to stay away from gambling in Quran phase and verse</h1><p>Gambling has been present in human societies since antiquity. Evidence of organized gambling can be found in many ancient texts, including the Bible and the Qur’an. Gambling is an issue that continues to generate much religious and moral debate, as it is seen as both morally repugnant and a source of great personal temptation.</p>
<p>Islam forbids gambling in all its forms. There are many verses in the Qur’an that deal with the prohibition of gambling, including these:</p>
<p>“They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say, “In them there is great harm and some benefit for people, but their harm is greater than their benefit.” And they ask you what they should spend. Say, “What you can spare.” Allah does not want to place you in difficulty, but wants to cleanse you and to complete His favor upon you that you may be grateful.” (Qur’an 2:219)</p>
<p>“O you who have believed, do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly but only trade by mutual consent. And do not kill yourselves. Indeed, Allah is ever Merciful to you.” (Qur’an 4:29)</p>
<p>“And they say, “Do not gamble,” and they are righteous? Jurists! They prohibit it while they themselves consume it.’” (Qur’an 2:219)</p>
<p>The wisdom behind the prohibition of gambling is that it leads to much social corruption and personal mischief. Gambling creates a false sense of hope and excitement, which often proves to be disastrous for those who become addicted to it.</p>

        <h1 id="Nevada-sees-largest-gambling-profits-in-history"><a href="#Nevada-sees-largest-gambling-profits-in-history" class="headerlink" title="Nevada sees largest gambling profits in history!"></a>Nevada sees largest gambling profits in history!</h1><p>According to reports, the Nevada Gaming Control Board has announced that gambling profits in the state have reached a new high. In fiscal year 2018, gambling revenue totaled $11.5 billion, up from $11.3 billion in 2017.</p>
<p>The increase was due in part to growth in the casino industry, with taxable revenues from gaming up 3.4% from the previous year. Slot machines accounted for the majority of the revenue growth, with revenues from those machines increasing by 4%.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Las Vegas was responsible for the lion’s share of gambling profits in Nevada. Gambling revenue in Las Vegas totaled $6.7 billion in fiscal year 2018, up from $6.5 billion in fiscal year 2017. This represented an increase of 3%.</p>
<p>The Strip was once again the main contributor to Las Vegas’ gambling profits, accounting for over three-quarters of all gambling revenue in the city. Revenue from slot machines on The Strip increased by 5%, while revenue from table games increased by 2%.</p>
<p>In addition to Las Vegas and Reno, other major gambling destinations in Nevada include Lake Tahoe and Laughlin. Gambling revenue at Lake Tahoe casinos totaled $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018, up from $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2017. Laughlin casinos saw a smaller increase, with gambling revenue rising from $464 million to $472 million over the same period.</p>
<p>Nevada’s booming gambling industry is good news for the state’s economy. Not only does it generate significant tax revenue, but it also creates jobs and supports businesses throughout the state. With gambling profits reaching new highs, it looks like this trend is likely to continue for some time yet!</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-legalizes-gambling-to-increase-house-profits"><a href="#Maryland-legalizes-gambling-to-increase-house-profits" class="headerlink" title="Maryland legalizes gambling to increase house profits!"></a>Maryland legalizes gambling to increase house profits!</h1><p>On Tuesday, Maryland lawmakers legalized gambling in order to increase the state’s house profits. This move is expected to bring in an additional $500 million in revenue for the state over the next five years. The new law allows for casinos, table games, and slot machines at five different locations – four of which are already up and running.</p>
<p>Critics of the bill argue that it will lead to an increase in addiction and crime rates, while supporters say that the additional revenue will help fund education and transportation initiatives. In any case, Maryland is not the only state to legalize gambling in order to increase revenues; similar measures have been enacted in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and other states in recent years.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for casino operators? Well, with more states legalizing gambling, competition is going to be fierce for those looking to set up shop. Operators will need to focus on offering a superior customer experience if they want to edge out the competition and make a profit. This could include enhanced amenities, better customer service, and more exciting gaming options.</p>
<p>At the same time, regulators will be keeping a close eye on casino operators to ensure that they are adhering to regulations and preventing any instances of fraud or illegal activities. With this added scrutiny, operators will need to be especially vigilant when it comes to compliance and risk management.</p>
<h1 id="The-Strip-seeing-declining-profits-from-gambling"><a href="#The-Strip-seeing-declining-profits-from-gambling" class="headerlink" title="The Strip seeing declining profits from gambling?"></a>The Strip seeing declining profits from gambling?</h1><p>According to recent news, the Strip is seeing a decline in profits from gambling. One of the main reasons mentioned is that people are now able to gamble online, which means they don’t have to go to Las Vegas or other gambling destinations.</p>
<p>This could be a huge issue for the city, as gambling is a major source of income for it. In fact, according to a study by University of Nevada, Las Vegas, gambling brought in around $9.2 billion in revenue in 2017. This accounted for around 31% of the city’s total revenue.</p>
<p>If this trend continues, it could mean big trouble for the city and its residents. Not only could it lead to job losses, but it could also mean less money being put into things like schools and infrastructure.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how the city deals with this issue and whether or not it can find ways to bring in more revenue from other sources.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-failing-house-profits-from-gambling-down-50"><a href="#Atlantic-City-failing-house-profits-from-gambling-down-50" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City failing, house profits from gambling down 50%"></a>Atlantic City failing, house profits from gambling down 50%</h1><p>Gambling in Atlantic City is a failing business, with profits from house gambling down 50 percent from their 2007 levels, according to a report from the UNLV Center for Gaming Research.</p>
<p>Atlantic City casinos took in $2.5 billion from house gambling in 2016, down from $5.2 billion in 2007. Slot revenue was down 41 percent over that time period, and table games were down 54 percent.</p>
<p>The market for gambling has changed dramatically in the last decade, with new casinos opening in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and New York. Those states have eaten into the market share of Atlantic City casinos.</p>
<p>In addition, casino revenues have been hurt by the extension of legalized gambling to other parts of the country. Casinos have sprouted up all around the Las Vegas area, and more recently in Oklahoma and neighboring states in Texas.</p>
<p>Atlantic City mayor Don Guardian said that his city is “fighting for our lives” and needs state help to turn things around. The state Legislature is currently considering a package of bills that would provide financial assistance to Atlantic City.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-on-the-rise-again-in-Las-Vegas-boosting-house-profits"><a href="#Gambling-on-the-rise-again-in-Las-Vegas-boosting-house-profits" class="headerlink" title="Gambling on the rise again in Las Vegas - boosting house profits"></a>Gambling on the rise again in Las Vegas - boosting house profits</h1><p>The house always wins in Las Vegas – and with gambling revenues on the rise once again, that is certainly proving to be the case.</p>
<p>Casinos in Sin City raked in $2.36 billion in July, up 6.8 percent from the same month last year, according to data released Wednesday by Nevada’s Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>Slot machines were once again responsible for the lion’s share of that revenue, accounting for more than $1.5 billion of it. That was a 7 percent increase from July 2017.</p>
<p>Baccarat also saw a healthy uptick, with revenues rising 15 percent to $85 million. Roulette and blackjack both saw more modest gains of 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Overall, casino gambling revenues have now grown for six consecutive months in Nevada – something that had not happened since early 2015. The state currently has 40 casinos operating, with another three set to open before the end of this year.</p>
<p>The resurgence in gambling is providing a much-needed boost for the casinos, which have been struggling in recent years amid increased competition from neighboring states and a sluggish economy. In fact, Strip casinos experienced their first collective annual decline in gaming revenue last year since 2009.</p>
<p>But with gamblers once again flocking to Las Vegas in droves, the casinos are starting to see some healthy profits again. In addition to the increase in overall gambling revenues, casino profits also rose 6 percent in July to $251 million. That’s good news for companies like MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts Ltd., which saw their stock prices rise earlier this week on the back of the positive gaming data.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-gambling-and-not-pay-taxes"><a href="#How-to-gambling-and-not-pay-taxes" class="headerlink" title="How to gambling and not pay taxes"></a>How to gambling and not pay taxes</h1><p>Gambling in the United States can be a fun and profitable pastime, but it’s important to understand the tax implications before you start gambling. Gambling income is taxable, and the IRS expects taxpayers to report their gambling winnings on their tax returns.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to minimize your taxes on gambling income. Here are four tips for reducing your tax liability on gambling winnings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Report Your Winnings</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step in reducing your taxes on gambling income is to accurately report all of your winnings on your tax return. This includes both winning bets and jackpots. Reporting your winnings is the most important step in minimizing your tax liability, so make sure to keep accurate records of all of your gambling activity.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Claim Gambling Losses as well</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to reporting your winnings, you can also claim any gambling losses as a deduction on your tax return. This will help offset any taxes you owe on your gambling income. To claim gambling losses, you need to keep track of how much you lose overall each year. You can then deduct this amount from your total gambling income when filing your taxes.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use a Tax professional</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re not comfortable doing your own taxes, consider hiring a tax professional to help you minimize your liability. A good tax preparer will know how to properly report your gambling income and deductions, ensuring that you pay the least amount of taxes possible.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Deduct Casino Travel Costs</li>
</ol>
<p>Another potential deduction for gamblers is casino travel costs. If you travel specifically to gamble at a casino, you may be able to deduct those costs from your taxable income. This includes airfare, hotel expenses, and other related costs. Make sure to keep accurate records of these costs if you plan to claim them as a deduction.</p>

Whether you prefer the excitement of slot machines or the strategic play of poker, there are plenty of opportunities to gamble without paying taxes.</p>
<p>This article will show you how to make the most of tax-free gambling in Canada. We’ll start by discussing the different types of gambling and providing an overview of the applicable tax laws. Next, we’ll walk you through some tips for maximizing your tax savings. Finally, we’ll provide a few key considerations when choosing a gambling destination.</p>
<p>So let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="The-Types-of-Gambling"><a href="#The-Types-of-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="The Types of Gambling"></a>The Types of Gambling</h3><p>There are three main types of gambling in Canada: casino games, lotteries, and sports betting. Casino games include slots, blackjack, roulette, and so on. Lotteries include provincial lotteries such as Lotto 6&#x2F;49 and international lotteries such as EuroMillions. Sports betting refers to bets placed on sporting events.</p>
<p>The type of gambling that offers the best tax savings varies depending on your province or territory of residence. In general, however, casino games offer the best tax savings because they have the highest expected return-to-player (RTP) percentage. For example, the RTP for slot machines in Quebec is approximately 94%, while it is only approximately 82% in British Columbia.</p>
<p>Lotteries typically have lower RTP percentages than casino games because they include fixed-odds games such as keno and scratchcards. Sports betting generally has the lowest RTP percentage because it is more volatile than other forms of gambling.</p>

<li>Gambling losses can be deducted from gambling winnings to reduce your taxable income; and</li>
<li>Gambling income earned outside Canada is not subject to Canadian income tax.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above exemptions are based on federal tax law. Each province and territory has its own set of rules with respect to gambling taxation, so please consult your local taxation authority for more information. For example, Quebec allows residents to deduct their losses up to $ pathological losses incurred during the year ), while Alberta does not offer any specific exemptions for gambling income .</p>

However, there are many other types of gambling, including betting on sports or trading stocks.</p>
<p>No matter what form it takes, gambling is always a risky proposition. You might win big, but you might also lose everything you’ve put in.</p>
<p>Gambling is also a tax-free activity. That may be about to change, however. The Australian government is considering introducing a new tax on gambling profits.</p>
<p>The proposed tax would apply to all forms of gambling, including online betting and casino games. It would be levied at a rate of 10%.</p>
<p>The main reason for the proposed tax is to help recover some of the billions of dollars lost each year to gambling-related problems. The government estimates that the new tax would raise around $300 million per year.</p>
<p>There has been strong opposition to the proposed tax from the gambling industry and others who argue that it will drive business offshore. They also argue that it will hit low and middle income earners the hardest.</p>
<p>Those opposed to the tax have until 20 September 2017 to make their submissions to the government’s consultation process.</p>

        <h1 id="Michigan-Poised-to-be-Next-State-to-Offer-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Michigan-Poised-to-be-Next-State-to-Offer-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Poised to be Next State to Offer Online Gambling"></a>Michigan Poised to be Next State to Offer Online Gambling</h1><p>Michigan lawmakers are considering a bill that would legalize and regulate online gambling within the state. The proposed legislation, which was introduced in late January, has been referred to the House Committee on Regulatory Reform.</p>
<p>Michigan is one of several states that have been eyeing online gambling as a potential new revenue stream. If the Michigan bill is approved, it would become the fourth state to offer online gambling, joining New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada.</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, Michigan residents would be able to gamble on casino games, poker, and other types of betting via the internet. The bill would also authorize licensed operators to offer mobile gambling services.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation has received support from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. As with other states that have legalized online gambling, proponents say that it would help generate much-needed revenue for the state budget. They also argue that it would provide a new source of entertainment for Michigan residents.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling say that it can be addictive and lead to financial problems for players. They also warn that it could be used by illegal organizations to launder money.</p>
<p>So far, there is no indication when or whether the Michigan bill will come up for a vote. In the meantime, lawmakers in other states are also considering proposals to legalize online gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-Cements-Position-as-Key-State-in-the-Online-Gambling-Industry"><a href="#Michigan-Cements-Position-as-Key-State-in-the-Online-Gambling-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Cements Position as Key State in the Online Gambling Industry"></a>Michigan Cements Position as Key State in the Online Gambling Industry</h1><p>Michigan has always been a major player in the gambling industry, but over the past few years, it has become an even more important state when it comes to online gambling. This is thanks in part to Michigan’s expansive and ever-growing online poker market, as well as its emergence as a top casino gaming destination.</p>
<p>The expansion of the Michigan online poker market is largely due to the state’s decision to legalize iGaming in late 2013. At that time, Michigan was one of just a handful of states with legalized online poker. The state had been considering legalizing online poker for some time beforehand, and when it finally happened, it was a major victory for the industry.</p>
<p>Since then, Michigan’s online poker market has continued to grow at a healthy rate. In 2018, Michigan was home to nearly 1 million registered online poker players – the fourth-largest population of any U.S. state. And this number is only expected to continue rising in the years ahead.</p>
<p>This growth is not only good news for Michigan’s online poker industry; it is also great news for its casino gaming industry. Michigan is now home to some of the country’s most popular casinos, including MotorCity Casino Hotel, MGM Grand Detroit Casino, and Greektown Casino-Hotel. These casinos are all located in Detroit, which is now one of the top gambling destinations in North America.</p>
<p>The combination of a burgeoning online poker market and some of the country’s most popular casinos has helped make Michigan into one of the key states in the online gambling industry. As this trend continues in the years ahead, we can expect Michigan to play an even more important role in the future of iGaming</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-Joins-Growing-Number-of-States-with-Legal-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Michigan-Joins-Growing-Number-of-States-with-Legal-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Joins Growing Number of States with Legal Online Gambling"></a>Michigan Joins Growing Number of States with Legal Online Gambling</h1><p>Michigan has become the latest state to legalize online gambling, with Governor Snyder signing a bill into law on October 29th. This makes Michigan the sixth state to legalize some form of online gambling, joining Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>The Michigan bill allows for both casino-style games and poker, with licenses granted to commercial and tribal casinos. The first phase of the rollout will see online lottery ticket sales available in November, with other types of gambling becoming available in 2020.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it will help to grow the Michigan casino industry, which is currently worth $2.5 billion a year. They also argue that it will help to create jobs and boost tourism.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial problems for players. There are also concerns that it could be used for money laundering and other criminal activities.</p>
<p>So far there has been little evidence of widespread problems with legalized online gambling in other states. However, this may change as more states legalize it and more people start to gamble online.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-Betting-on-its-Future-as-a-Leader-in-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Michigan-Betting-on-its-Future-as-a-Leader-in-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Betting on its Future as a Leader in Online Gambling"></a>Michigan Betting on its Future as a Leader in Online Gambling</h1><p>Michigan lawmakers are looking at ways to legalize and regulate online gambling within the state’s borders. This would make Michigan the fourth US state to do so, after New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada. The proposed bill, which has been making its way through the legislature, would establish a licensing and regulatory framework for operators of online gambling websites.</p>
<p> The state believes that regulating online gambling will help generate much-needed revenue for its coffers. It is estimated that Michigan could take in as much as $200 million per year in tax revenue from online gambling operations. In addition, the regulated market would create jobs and boost the economies of local communities.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill stress that it would include strong consumer protections. These would include measures to protect players from problem gambling, ensure the integrity of games, and prevent money laundering. The bill also includes provisions for responsible advertising and marketing by operators.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to social ills such as addiction and crime. They also say that it could be difficult to enforce given the fact that people can gamble from anywhere in the world using their phones or computers.</p>
<p>Michigan is just one of several states currently considering measures to legalize online gambling. Lawmakers in Pennsylvania, Illinois, California, and Iowa are also looking at ways to bring this type of gambling within their borders.</p>
<h1 id="Time-for-Michigan-to-Get-in-the-Game-The-Potential-for-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Time-for-Michigan-to-Get-in-the-Game-The-Potential-for-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Time for Michigan to Get in the Game: The Potential for Online Gambling"></a>Time for Michigan to Get in the Game: The Potential for Online Gambling</h1><p>Michigan could be missing out on a big opportunity if it doesn’t legalize online gambling. Citizens of the state are already spending millions of dollars a year gambling online, and the state is missing out on the tax revenue that could be generated by legalizing and regulating the industry.</p>
<p>There is already a lot of support for online gambling in Michigan. A poll conducted in 2016 found that 63 percent of Michigan voters supported legalizing online gambling. And there are good reasons for that support. Online gambling would generate much-needed revenue for the state, it would create jobs, and it would protect consumers from scams and predatory practices.</p>
<p>Online gambling is already a big business in Michigan. A study by the University of Maryland estimated that Michigan residents spent more than $206 million on illegal online gambling in 2014. That’s more than $600 per resident. If Michigan were to legalize and regulate online gambling, it could generate as much as $60 million in annual tax revenue.</p>
<p>The potential for online gambling goes beyond just generating tax revenue. It also has the potential to create jobs. The Silverton Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, for example, has about 1,000 employees who work in its online poker room. If Michigan were to legalize online gambling, it could create similar jobs in the state.</p>
<p>Online gambling can also be helpful to consumers. It can be a safer way to gamble than visiting an unregulated offshore site. And it can allow people to gamble from the comfort of their own homes, which can be helpful for those who have addiction problems or who live in rural areas where there are no casinos or other places to gamble.</p>
<p>There is no question that online gambling has benefits for Michigan. The only question is whether the state is willing to take advantage of those benefits.</p>

There are some common mistakes that new businesses make when getting started in the online gambling industry, which can often lead to failure. In order to help you avoid these costly errors, we’ve compiled a list of the top five mistakes to avoid when starting an online gambling business.</p>
<ol>
<li>Not Conducting Enough Research</li>
</ol>
<p>This may be the most important rule of them all – do your research! Too often, entrepreneurs dive into a new venture without fully understanding the industry or what it takes to be successful. This can be especially true for online gambling businesses, which can be complex and require a great deal of knowledge about both the legal landscape and the customer base. Before starting your business, make sure you know as much as possible about the industry and what it will take to be successful.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Not Having a Clear Vision</li>
</ol>
<p>Having a clear vision is another critical component of any successful business. When starting an online gambling operation, you need to have a specific goal in mind and work towards achieving it. Whether you want to become the biggest operator in the industry or just focus on one specific market, having a defined goal will help you stay focused and achieve success.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Focusing Too Much on Money and Not Enough on Customers</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s certainly important to have a healthy respect for profits and understand the importance of making money in order to stay afloat in any business, but it’s also critical not to lose sight of the customer base. In online gambling, this means making sure that you offer an excellent user experience across all devices and platforms, provide valuable content and promotions, and offer quick and easy payment options. If you focus too much on making money without considering your customers, you’ll likely end up losing them – and your business – eventually.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Underestimating Competition</li>
</ol>
<p>Just like any other industry, online gambling is competitive and there are many other businesses vying for customers’ attention. This means that if you don’t take your competition seriously and put in the effort necessary to stand out from the pack, you’ll likely find yourself at a disadvantage very quickly. Do your research on competing businesses and find ways to set yourself apart by offering something unique or better value for customers.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Not Being Fully Licensed&#x2F;Compliant</li>
</ol>
<p>This may be one of the most serious mistakes that can lead to the downfall of an online gambling business. Operating without proper licensing or compliance can lead to hefty fines, lawsuits and even criminal charges – so it’s absolutely essential to make sure you are fully compliant with all relevant laws before launching your business!</p>
<h1 id="What-It-Takes-to-Start-an-Online-Gambling-Business"><a href="#What-It-Takes-to-Start-an-Online-Gambling-Business" class="headerlink" title="What It Takes to Start an Online Gambling Business"></a>What It Takes to Start an Online Gambling Business</h1><p>There are many things entrepreneurs need to think about when starting a new business. But for those who want to open an online gambling business, there are a few extra steps that need to be taken. </p>
<p>To start, you need to make sure your jurisdiction allows gambling businesses. In the United States, for example, each state has its own laws governing gambling, so you’ll need to do your homework on this front. </p>
<p>Once you’ve ascertained that it’s legal to start an online gambling business in your area, you’ll need to get a license from the appropriate regulator. This is often a cost-intensive and time-consuming process, but it’s necessary if you want to avoid any legal trouble down the road. </p>
<p>In addition, you’ll need to make sure your website is compliant with relevant safety and security standards. This means investing in top-notch security software and making sure your employees are well-trained in data security procedures. </p>
<p>Finally, you should make sure that your customers have a positive experience when playing on your site. This means providing excellent customer service and offering a wide variety of games and betting options. </p>
<p>If you can tick all these boxes, then you’re ready to start an online gambling business!</p>
