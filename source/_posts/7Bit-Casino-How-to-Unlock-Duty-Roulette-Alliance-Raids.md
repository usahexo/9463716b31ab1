#  7Bit Casino: How to Unlock Duty Roulette Alliance Raids

Duty Roulette is undoubtedly one of the most popular features in the game of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. There is something about its allure that has players coming back time and time again to participate in its various activities, whether it be the high-paying rewards, or the promise of excitement and adventure.

Most recently, the Duty Roulette: Alliance Raids has been introduced as a way for players to team up with others and take on some of the most difficult content in the game. However, simply queueing for the roulette does not guarantee that you will be able to participate in an Alliance Raid – there are certain steps that you need to take in order to unlock them.

In this article, we will be taking a look at what those steps are, so that you can start raiding with your friends as soon as possible!

The first step is simply to complete the main scenario quest line. This is a requirement for unlocking any of the alliance raids, so it is something that you will need to do sooner rather than later. The good news is that once you have completed this step, all of the alliance raids will be available to you, no matter which difficulty you have chosen.

The next step is to make sure that your party is properly prepared for raid content. In order to do this, you will need at least three members who have reached level 70, and have completed all of the appropriate story quests for their class/job. It is also recommended that each player has a full set of 50-ton gear (or better), along with some other helpful items such as food and potions. You can find more information on what gear is required for each raid tier on Blizzard’s website.

Once you have met all of these requirements, it’s time to start queuing for the Duty Roulette: Alliance Raids! Note that if your party does not meet all of the requirements listed above, you will not be able to participate in the raid.

Assuming everything goes smoothly and your party manages to clear the raid, congratulations – you have now officially unlocked it! Be sure to continue preparing yourself and your party members for future raids by continuing to upgrade your gear and honing your skills. There are plenty of challenging encounters ahead, so be sure to come prepared!

#  7Bit Casino: A Guide to Unlocking the Duty Roulette Alliance Raids

The duty roulette alliance raids are a set of high-level raids that are inaccessible until certain requirements have been met. The alliance raids become available after the player has completed the main scenario quest “Brave New World” and unlocked the duty roulette intermediate.

The first step is to complete the 3 alliance raids quests, which become available after the player completes the main scenario quest “Into a Copper Hell.” The alliance raid quests are:

Quest: A Familiar Face 
Level Requirement: 50 
Item Level Requirement: 190 
Party Size: 8 players (4 front line + 4 back line) 
Time Limit: 60 minutes
The objective of this quest is to clear Deltascape V4.0 Sigmascape V4.0 and Omega Savage in under 60 minutes. This is a very difficult task and will require excellent organization and execution from your party. Make sure you are familiar with each of these fights before attempting this quest.

Quest: Duty Roulette - Alliance Raids 
Level Requirement: 70 
Item Level Requirement: 210 
Party Size: 8 players (4 front line + 4 back line) 
Time Limit: 150 minutes 
The objective of this quest is to clear The Royal City of Rabanastre, The Keeper of the Lake, and The psychedelic Castle in under 150 minutes. This is a much more achievable goal than the previous quest, but still requires good organization and execution. Like the previous quest, make sure you are familiar with each of these fights before attempting this quest.

Raiding in Duty Roulette is one of the most efficient means to obtain Gil and experience points. The key to a successful raid is having a balanced party, made up of damage dealers, tanks and healers.

Before starting a raid, it is important to choose the right dungeon. Not all dungeons are created equal and some are more difficult than others.
The easiest dungeons to raid are listed below:
· The Fractal Continuum (level 45)
· The Lost City of Amdapor (level 50)
· Hullbreaker Isle (level 50)
· Snowcloak (level 60)
· Sastasha (level 60)
· Tam-Tara Deepcroft (level 60)
· Pharos Sirius (level 70)

To start a raid, select Duty Roulette from the main menu and then select Alliance Raids. You will then be presented with a list of available raids. Choose the raid you wish to participate in and click on the Join button. Your party will then be entered into the queue and will start queuing for the next available instance. 
Once your party has been placed into an instance, you will need to defeat all of the enemies in order to progress to the next stage. There are usually three stages in a raid, with each stage consisting of a different set of enemies. 
Once all three stages have been completed, your party will be rewarded with experience points and Gil. The amount of experience points and Gil awarded depends on the difficulty of the raid and your party's performance. 


#  A Beginner's Guide To 7Bit Casino's Duty Roulette Alliance

When it comes to multiplayer gaming, few activities are as satisfying as taking down enemy players in coordinated strikes. MMOs and shooters offer some of the best teamwork experiences around, but there’s something uniquely exhilarating about cooperating with others to take on a common task in an RPG. That’s where duty roulette comes in.

Duty roulette is a random encounter mode that pits your party of adventurers against a series of difficult challenges. It can be accessed from the main menu at any time, and is available in a variety of different levels of difficulty. The key to success lies in cooperation; while you can complete many of the encounters solo, they are designed to be tackled as a group.

One of the best things about duty roulette is that it offers great rewards for players who manage to complete its challenges. Not only do you get bragging rights among your friends, but you can also earn some valuable experience points and loot. In order to help you get started, we’ve put together this beginner’s guide to 7Bit Casino's Duty Roulette Alliance.

The first step is to select the right party composition for the encounter. While any combination of characters will work for some fights, others will be much more difficult with certain classes or job roles left out. Make sure everyone is on the same page before starting the battle – if someone dies early on, it could spell disaster for the rest of the team.

Pay attention to your surroundings and plan ahead. Many of the encounters in duty roulette can be won or lost based on your ability to make use of the battlefield environment. For example, if you see a large group of enemies clustered together, try using area-of-effect abilities to take them all out at once. Conversely, if you find yourself up against a powerful boss flanked by weaker minions, try taking out the support first so you can focus on the bigger threat.

Lastly, don’t be afraid to ask for help when needed! If someone in your group starts struggling mid-battle, reach out to other players in chat and see if anyone can lend a hand. Working together is essential for success in duty roulette – so don’t be shy and ask for help whenever you need it.
