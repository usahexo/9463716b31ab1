#  Baccarat Rouge to Feature Notes of Red Fruit and Floral Bouquet

Created in 1888 by Maurice Hennessy, Baccarat Rouge is a cognac soon to be released with a flavor profile reminiscent of red fruit and floral bouquet. 

Hennessy master blender Yann Fillioux has created this new cognac, which will be available in November 2018. The bouquet is said to include notes of cherry, raspberry, blackberry, and currant, while the taste features more complex flavors of wood and spices. 

Baccarat Rouge is made from eaux-de-vie that are at least 15 years old. The cognac is bottled at 42% alcohol by volume. 

“With its intense red fruit flavors and characteristic floral bouquet, Baccarat Rouge is an excellent choice for those who appreciate fine cognacs with pronounced character,” said Fillioux. 

This new release from Hennessy will join the company’s existing line of Baccarat cognacs, which includes: Baccarat Extra Old, Baccarat VSOP Privilège, and Baccarat Napoleon.

#  Baccarat Rouge to Feature a Stronger Scent Than Its Predecessor

When Baccarat Rouge was first released in the market, a lot of people found it dissatisfying because of its relatively weaker scent. With this in mind, the brand has come up with a new version that is set to be released very soon.

The new Baccarat Rouge will have a much stronger scent, something that should make it more appealing to those who were not happy with the original. It will also come in a different bottle, one that is more elongated and elegantly designed.

It is worth noting that the new fragrance will not be replacing the old one. Rather, it will be offered as an alternative for those who want something with a more powerful smell.
