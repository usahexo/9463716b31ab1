#  Congo bans blackjack in order to prevent card counting

Last week, the Congo Republic announced a ban on blackjack in order to prevent card counting and bolster state revenue from gambling. Blackjack is the only game currently subject to the ban.

The head of the state-run gaming authority, Jean-Jacques Bawa, justified the move, stating that "the ban is necessary to prevent professional gamblers from taking advantage of the game." He added that the ban would also allow the government to better regulate gambling and collect taxes on winnings.

Opposition figures criticised the move, saying that it would lead to increased illegal gambling. Gérard Kassongo, an opposition lawmaker, said that "the decision will only encourage illegal activity since it is well known that blackjack is one of the games where one can make money."

Casinos in Congo offer blackjack and other table games such as roulette and poker, as well as slot machines. The government has not said whether it plans to ban those games in order to thwart card counters.

#  How to count cards like a pro at blackjack in Congo

The game of blackjack is one that can be enjoyed by players of all experience levels. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced player, counting cards can be a useful tool to help you improve your odds of winning at the table. In this article, we will teach you how to count cards like a pro at blackjack in Congo.

To start off, you will need to learn the basic counting system. In this system, there are only two numbers – 0 and 1. Whenever a card with a value of 2 through 6 is dealt, the number 0 is added to the running total. Whenever a card with a value of 7 through Ace is dealt, the number 1 is added to the running total. So, if you had a running total of 5 before the deal, and the first two cards revealed were a 3 and a 4, then the running total would become 8 (3+4=7+1=8).

Once you have learned how to count cards using the basic system, you can begin to use more advanced techniques. One such technique is called ‘true count’. To calculate true count, you will need to divide the current running total by the number of decks remaining in the shoe. This will give you an estimate of how many cards have been played since the last shuffle. You can then use this number to adjust your basic count accordingly. For example, if there are six decks remaining in the shoe and your running total is 12, then your true count is 2 (12/6=2). This means that there are actually twice as many high-value cards left in the deck as there are low-value cards. Therefore, you would want to adjust your betting strategy accordingly when playing at this particular table.

Another advanced counting technique that can be used is called ‘card counting systems’. There are many different types of card counting systems out there, but most of them work on the same principle – they assign different point values to different groups of cards. For instance, some systems might assign +1 point value to face cards and Aces, while assigning -1 point value to 2s through 6s. This allows players to make more accurate predictions about what types of cards are likely to be dealt next.

As mentioned earlier, counting cards is not an exact science – there is always some margin for error involved. However, if done correctly, it can be an extremely useful tool for improving your odds at blackjack in Congo. So why not give it a try?

#  Blackjack players win big thanks to card counting in Congo

A small group of blackjack players in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been taking casinos by storm by using a simple but effective card counting strategy. The players are able to win large sums of money by keeping track of the cards that have been played, and then betting accordingly.

The casinos have been trying to counteract the players' advantage by shuffling the cards more often, but this has only served to make the game more difficult for everyone else. The blackjack players have become so successful that they have even started setting up their own tables in some establishments.

While card counting is not illegal, it is frowned upon by casinos, and can get you barred from playing if you are caught. So far, the players in Congo seem to be getting away with it, but as more and more people catch on to their tactics, it may not be long before the casinos put an end to their winning streak.

#  Card counting helps casino players beat the odds in Congo

Blackjack is a casino game that offers players the chance to beat the house by counting cards. But what’s the best way to do this? One effective technique is called card counting, and it involves keeping track of which cards have been dealt and assigning a point value to them. When the high cards (cards with a point value of 10 or higher) are dealt, the player has an advantage because the likelihood of getting a winning hand is higher. By keeping track of which cards have been played, the player can make informed decisions about when to bet and when to hold back.

One place where card counting can be used to great effect is in Congo, where blackjack is one of the most popular casino games. In Congo, as in other parts of Africa, casinos are often found in luxury hotels and offer high-stakes gaming options. While there are always risks involved in gambling, learning how to count cards can give players a better chance of beating the house and walking away with some profits.

While card counting does take some practice, it’s a skill that anyone can learn. There are plenty of online tutorials available that will walk you through all the steps necessary to become a successful card counter. And once you’ve mastered the basics, you can put your skills to use at any casino in Africa – or anywhere else in the world.

#  Is card counting legal in Congo? Find out before you play!

Gambling is a popular pastime all over the world, and there are many different ways to gamble. One of the most popular casino games is blackjack, which can be played with cards or online. If you're playing blackjack in Congo, you may be wondering if card counting is legal there.

The good news is that card counting is not illegal in Congo. However, it's important to understand that casinos can ban players who are caught counting cards, so it's important to be discreet if you decide to use this strategy.

There are a few things to keep in mind if you want to start counting cards in Congo. First, you'll need to know the basic rules of blackjack. Next, you'll need to practice counting cards until you become proficient at it. Finally, you'll need to find a reputable casino that allows card counters.

Once you've got all of that squared away, it's time to start counting! Begin by keeping track of the high and low cards as they are played. As long as the deck is heavily weighted in favor of the dealer (or "house"), you'll want to bet small amounts or even fold your hand. But when the deck becomes more favourable to the player (the "player" deck), that's when betting big can be profitable.

It takes a lot of practice and discipline to become a successful card counter, but if you're willing to put in the work, it can be a very profitable way to gamble in Congo. Just make sure you stay within the law and don't get caught cheating!
