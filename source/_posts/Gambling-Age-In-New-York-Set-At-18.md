#  Gambling Age In New York Set At 18

Governor Andrew Cuomo has set the gambling age in New York at 18 in his proposed state budget. The previous gambling age was 21. The change is part of Cuomo's effort to legalize casino gambling in upstate New York. Gambling supporters argue that the legal age should be the same as when someone can legally drink alcohol.

Opponents of the proposal say that setting the gambling age at 18 will increase gambling addiction problems in young people. They also argue that casinos are not appropriate for upstate New York, which is a rural and agricultural area.

Cuomo's proposal would allow for up to seven casinos to be built in upstate New York. The first would be open in three years if the budget is approved by the state legislature.

#  New York's Gambling Age: 18 Years Old

In New York, the gambling age is 18 years old. Anyone younger than that is not allowed to gamble in any of the state's casinos, racetracks, or bingo halls.

While this may seem like a relatively young age to allow gambling, there are actually good reasons for it. First of all, 18-year-olds are considered adults in New York, and are allowed to do all sorts of other things that require responsibility and maturity, like vote or serve in the military. So it only makes sense that they would also be allowed to gamble if they so choose.

Second of all, research shows that most people don't start gambling until they reach adulthood anyway. Gambling addiction is a real problem, but it tends to affect people who have started gambling by a younger age. Allowing 18-year-olds to gamble will help keep them away from any potential problems until they're more mature and better able to handle them.

Finally, some people argue that allowing 18-year-olds to gamble can actually be beneficial for them. It can teach them how to handle their money responsibly and make wise decisions when it comes to spending their money. And it can also give them a way to have some fun and let off some steam in a safe and controlled environment.

So overall, there are many good reasons why New York has set the gambling age at 18 years old. It allows adults to make their own decisions, it helps keep minors away from potential problems, and it can even be beneficial for some people.

#  Ages For Gambling In New York's Different Regions

Gambling in New York is available in different regions with different ages. In the Catskills, the age to gamble is 18 years old. In Central New York, the age is 21 years old. Finally, in Western New York, the age is 21 years old. 

Each of these regions has a different set of casinos that are open to those within their respective gambling age range. The Catskills region offers nine casinos while Central New York offers just four. Western New York offers the most casinos with a total of 17. 

Despite having more options, Western New Yorkers seem to be less interested in gambling. The region has seen a steady decline in revenue from its casinos since 2006. In contrast, both Catskills and Central New York have seen an increase in gambling revenue over the same period of time. 

One possible explanation for this trend is that Central and Catskill residents are closer to major metropolitan areas like Syracuse and Albany where they can access other forms of entertainment as well. Western New Yorkers may have fewer choices and be more likely to visit casinos as a result.

If you're wondering what the gambling age is in New York, you'll be happy to know that it's 18. This applies to all forms of gambling, from casinos and racinos to lottery tickets and bingo.

The minimum age for gambling is set by the New York State Constitution, which states that "the Legislature shall have the power to authorize by law… the sale of lottery tickets and the operation of games of chance by any corporation or association which is not prohibited by the constitution of this state."
