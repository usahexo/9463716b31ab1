#  Hoffenheim falls to 1899 Munich in Bundesliga action 

Hoffenheim went down to 1899 Munich 3-1 in Bundesliga action on Saturday. The home side had the majority of chances in the match, but were not able to convert them. 1899 took the lead in the first half through a goal from Mittelstadt and then extended their lead in the second half through goals from Kübler and Robben. Hoffenheim was only able to get one goal back through a strike from Belfodil.

 1899 Munich has now moved up to third place in the Bundesliga with 46 points, while Hoffenheim falls to seventh place with 41 points. Next weekend, 1899 Munich will take on Bayer Leverkusen, who are in second place in the Bundesliga, while Hoffenheim will take on last-place Hannover 96.

#  1899 Hoffenheim falls to Borussia Dortmund in German Cup semifinal 

The 1899 Hoffenheim football club has been eliminated from the German Cup after a semifinal loss to Borussia Dortmund. Hoffenheim was hoping to make it to the final and lift their first ever cup trophy, but they were ultimately unable to overcome Dortmund.

It was a tight match, with Hoffenheim scoring first in the 34th minute through Nadiem Amiri. However, Dortmund would fight back and equalize just 10 minutes later through André Schürrle. The match went into extra time, and there was no further score so it would have to be decided by penalties. Unfortunately for Hoffenheim, they would lose the shootout 4-2, meaning that they will not be playing in the final next month.

This certainly isn't the end of the season for Hoffenheim, as they are still in contention for a Champions League place. They currently sit in 4th place in the Bundesliga table, just two points behind 3rd-place Eintracht Frankfurt. There are still six matches remaining in the Bundesliga season, so they will need to continue playing well if they want to seal a spot in Europe's top club competition.

#  1899 Hoffenheim loses by 3 goals to Eintracht Frankfurt in Bundesliga outing 

Losing by three goals to Eintracht Frankfurt, 1899 Hoffenheim falls further down the Bundesliga table. With just two wins in their past ten outings, Hoffenheim are looking far from secure in their top-flight status this season.

The hosts had plenty of chances in the game but were ultimately undone by a clinical display from Frankfurt. Sebastien Haller netted twice, with Ante Rebic also on target as the Eagles moved up to seventh in the table.

For Hoffenheim, it was another disappointing result and leaves them languishing in 13th position. Julian Nagelsmann's side will need to start picking up wins if they are to avoid getting dragged into a relegation battle this season.

#  1899 Hoffenheim falls to Bayer Leverkusen in final match of the season

Hoffenheim, which finished in fourth place in the Bundesliga standings, was unable to overcome Bayer Leverkusen, a team that finished in twelfth place in the standings. The match ended with a score of 2-1 in favor of Bayer Leverkusen.

 1899 Hoffenheim began the game aggressively, creating several scoring opportunities in the early minutes. However, Bayer Leverkusen was able to score first with a goal from Karim Bellarabi in the 23rd minute. Hoffenheim continued to attack but was not able to score before halftime.

In the second half, Hoffenheim equalized with a goal from Andrej Kramaric in the 50th minute. However, Bayer Leverkusen regained the lead just four minutes later with a goal from Julian Brandt. This goal proved to be the game-winner as Hoffenheim was not able to score again.

With this loss, 1899 Hoffenheim will miss out on qualifying for next season’s UEFA Champions League. This is the first time since 2012-2013 that Hoffenheim will not participate in Europe’s top club competition.
