One of Coppola’s most famous films is “The Godfather”, which was released in 1972. The movie was a box office success and it won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

In 1973, Coppola co-founded the production company American Zoetrope with George Lucas. The company went on to produce a number of successful films, including “Apocalypse Now” and “The Outsiders”.

Coppola has also directed a number of music videos for popular artists like The Doors and Michael Jackson.

Hollywood mogul Francis Ford Coppola just cashed in a cool million from a slot machine at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. The prolific 73-year-old director, producer, and screenwriter was playing the high-stakes "Dolphin Treasure" game when he hit the jackpot.

Casino mogul Francis Ford Coppola was seen in a very good mood yesterday as he left a popular casino in Las Vegas. He was all smiles and had a spring in his step, no doubt due to his recent big win on the slot machines!
