#  Jamie Saves Claire from Blackjack Congo!

Jamie stumbled towards the casino, clutching his chest. It felt like someone was stabbing him with a knife. He had to get to Claire.

The casino was in chaos. Smoke filled the air and the sound of gunfire echoed through the hallways. Jamie pushed past the panicked crowds, searching for his wife.

He finally found her near the blackjack table. A large gorilla was standing over her, menacingly raising a club in its hand.

"Thank you," she said breathlessly. "You saved my life."

"Of course," Jamie replied. "I would do anything for you."
