#  Nevada sees largest gambling profits in history!

According to reports, the Nevada Gaming Control Board has announced that gambling profits in the state have reached a new high. In fiscal year 2018, gambling revenue totaled $11.5 billion, up from $11.3 billion in 2017.

The increase was due in part to growth in the casino industry, with taxable revenues from gaming up 3.4% from the previous year. Slot machines accounted for the majority of the revenue growth, with revenues from those machines increasing by 4%.

Not surprisingly, Las Vegas was responsible for the lion's share of gambling profits in Nevada. Gambling revenue in Las Vegas totaled $6.7 billion in fiscal year 2018, up from $6.5 billion in fiscal year 2017. This represented an increase of 3%.

The Strip was once again the main contributor to Las Vegas' gambling profits, accounting for over three-quarters of all gambling revenue in the city. Revenue from slot machines on The Strip increased by 5%, while revenue from table games increased by 2%.

In addition to Las Vegas and Reno, other major gambling destinations in Nevada include Lake Tahoe and Laughlin. Gambling revenue at Lake Tahoe casinos totaled $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2018, up from $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2017. Laughlin casinos saw a smaller increase, with gambling revenue rising from $464 million to $472 million over the same period.

Nevada's booming gambling industry is good news for the state's economy. Not only does it generate significant tax revenue, but it also creates jobs and supports businesses throughout the state. With gambling profits reaching new highs, it looks like this trend is likely to continue for some time yet!

#  Maryland legalizes gambling to increase house profits!

On Tuesday, Maryland lawmakers legalized gambling in order to increase the state’s house profits. This move is expected to bring in an additional $500 million in revenue for the state over the next five years. The new law allows for casinos, table games, and slot machines at five different locations – four of which are already up and running.

Critics of the bill argue that it will lead to an increase in addiction and crime rates, while supporters say that the additional revenue will help fund education and transportation initiatives. In any case, Maryland is not the only state to legalize gambling in order to increase revenues; similar measures have been enacted in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and other states in recent years.

So what does this mean for casino operators? Well, with more states legalizing gambling, competition is going to be fierce for those looking to set up shop. Operators will need to focus on offering a superior customer experience if they want to edge out the competition and make a profit. This could include enhanced amenities, better customer service, and more exciting gaming options.

At the same time, regulators will be keeping a close eye on casino operators to ensure that they are adhering to regulations and preventing any instances of fraud or illegal activities. With this added scrutiny, operators will need to be especially vigilant when it comes to compliance and risk management.

#  The Strip seeing declining profits from gambling?

According to recent news, the Strip is seeing a decline in profits from gambling. One of the main reasons mentioned is that people are now able to gamble online, which means they don’t have to go to Las Vegas or other gambling destinations.

This could be a huge issue for the city, as gambling is a major source of income for it. In fact, according to a study by University of Nevada, Las Vegas, gambling brought in around $9.2 billion in revenue in 2017. This accounted for around 31% of the city’s total revenue.

If this trend continues, it could mean big trouble for the city and its residents. Not only could it lead to job losses, but it could also mean less money being put into things like schools and infrastructure.

It will be interesting to see how the city deals with this issue and whether or not it can find ways to bring in more revenue from other sources.

#  Atlantic City failing, house profits from gambling down 50%

Gambling in Atlantic City is a failing business, with profits from house gambling down 50 percent from their 2007 levels, according to a report from the UNLV Center for Gaming Research.

Atlantic City casinos took in $2.5 billion from house gambling in 2016, down from $5.2 billion in 2007. Slot revenue was down 41 percent over that time period, and table games were down 54 percent.

The market for gambling has changed dramatically in the last decade, with new casinos opening in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and New York. Those states have eaten into the market share of Atlantic City casinos.

In addition, casino revenues have been hurt by the extension of legalized gambling to other parts of the country. Casinos have sprouted up all around the Las Vegas area, and more recently in Oklahoma and neighboring states in Texas.

Atlantic City mayor Don Guardian said that his city is “fighting for our lives” and needs state help to turn things around. The state Legislature is currently considering a package of bills that would provide financial assistance to Atlantic City.

#  Gambling on the rise again in Las Vegas - boosting house profits

The house always wins in Las Vegas – and with gambling revenues on the rise once again, that is certainly proving to be the case.

Casinos in Sin City raked in $2.36 billion in July, up 6.8 percent from the same month last year, according to data released Wednesday by Nevada’s Gaming Control Board.

Slot machines were once again responsible for the lion’s share of that revenue, accounting for more than $1.5 billion of it. That was a 7 percent increase from July 2017.

Baccarat also saw a healthy uptick, with revenues rising 15 percent to $85 million. Roulette and blackjack both saw more modest gains of 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively.

Overall, casino gambling revenues have now grown for six consecutive months in Nevada – something that had not happened since early 2015. The state currently has 40 casinos operating, with another three set to open before the end of this year.

The resurgence in gambling is providing a much-needed boost for the casinos, which have been struggling in recent years amid increased competition from neighboring states and a sluggish economy. In fact, Strip casinos experienced their first collective annual decline in gaming revenue last year since 2009.

But with gamblers once again flocking to Las Vegas in droves, the casinos are starting to see some healthy profits again. In addition to the increase in overall gambling revenues, casino profits also rose 6 percent in July to $251 million. That’s good news for companies like MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts Ltd., which saw their stock prices rise earlier this week on the back of the positive gaming data.
