The two companies have agreed to cooperate in the fields of online gaming and e-sport. Tofaş will provide its know-how and technical infrastructure to TOP, while TOP will manage the gaming content and operations.

In a joint statement, Tofaş Chairman İlhami Soykan and TOP CEO Serdar Göker said that the partnership would enable them to offer a "unique experience" to Turkish gamers.

"Turkey is a very important market for us," Göker said. "We are excited to be working with Tofaş and to be able to offer our gamers the best possible experience."

#  Tofaş Announces Launch of Its Own Sports Betting Site

Tofaş, a leading Turkish conglomerate, has just announced the launch of its own sports betting site. The company has been in the motor vehicle industry for decades and is now making a foray into the iGaming market. Tofaş joins other top Turkish firms such as Turkcell and Garanti Bank in offering their own sports betting platforms.

The move by Tofaş is seen as a response to recent changes in the Turkish gambling legislation. Up until now, gamblers could only bet on football matches through state-owned sportsbook Milliyet Bahis. However, a new decree that came into effect in January allows for private operators to offer sports betting services as well. This has led to a surge in interest in the Turkish gambling market, with many foreign operators looking to set up shop there.

Tofaş’s new sports betting site offers a wide range of sporting events to bet on, including football, basketball, tennis, and rugby. Customers can also bet on non-sporting events such as political outcomes and TV shows. In addition to straight bets, the site also offers a variety of different casino games such as blackjack and roulette.

The company has already invested heavily in promoting its new site. It has launched a major advertising campaign that includes television commercials and online ads. Tofaş is hoping that its strong brand name will help it compete against the established players in the Turkish gambling market.
