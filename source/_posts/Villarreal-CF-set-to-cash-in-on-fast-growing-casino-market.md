#  Villarreal CF set to cash in on fast-growing casino market

Spanish football club Villarreal CF is looking to cash in on the fast-growing casino market by building its own casino.

The club, which was founded in 1923 and is based in Castellón de la Plana, has submitted a planning application to build the casino, which will be open to the public.

Villarreal CF said that the casino would create around 100 jobs and attract tourists to the area. It added that it had been considering the move for some time and that the club's board of directors had unanimously approved the project.

The casino will be built on land adjacent to Villarreal's El Madrigal stadium. Construction is due to start in 2019 and it is expected to be completed in 2020.

Villarreal CF isn't the only Spanish football club with its own casino; Atlético Madrid has one too. However, while Atlético's casino is open to members only, Villarreal's will be open to the general public.

Spain is home to around 70 casinos, which generated revenues of €2.8 billion in 2016. That figure is expected to grow to €4 billion by 2021, making Spain one of Europe's fastest-growing casino markets.

#  How Villarreal CF is making the big bucks from casino gaming

The La Liga club, Villarreal CF, has caught the eye of many with its impressive on field performance in the Spanish top-flight football league. But what is lesser known is that the club is also making money through casino gaming.

Villarreal CF entered into a partnership with PAF, a Malta-based gaming company, in 2016. In return for marketing and promotional rights, Villarreal CF receives a commission on all revenue generated by PAF from Spanish customers.

The partnership has been a huge success, with Villarreal CF seeing its revenues from casino gaming increase by over 300% in the past two years. In the 2017/2018 season, Villarreal CF generated €1.8 million from casino gaming, up from just €0.5 million in the 2016/2017 season.

This revenue stream has proved to be vital for the club, as it has helped to offset some of the financial losses incurred from relegation to La Liga 2 (the second division of Spanish football) in 2017.

Villarreal CF is not the only football club to partner with a gaming company. Many clubs across Europe have struck similar deals in order to boost their revenue streams.

For example, Juventus FC partnered with bwin in 2010, while AS Monaco FC partnered with Betclic in 2013. More recently, Manchester City FC announced a partnership with Dreamteam in 2018.

So why are football clubs turning to casino gaming as a source of revenue?

There are several reasons: firstly, casino gaming is a global industry worth billions of dollars and is growing at a rapid pace; secondly, gambling companies are willing to invest large sums of money into partnerships with football clubs; and thirdly, there is a natural synergy between football and gambling given that both involve risk and chance.

For football clubs, partnering with gambling companies provides an attractive source of revenue that can help offset financial losses incurred from poor on field performance or relegation. It also helps to build greater awareness and exposure for the club amongst its fans.

#  Villarreal CF leading the way in Spanish casino market

Villarreal CF are one of the most successful clubs in Spanish football, and they are also leading the way in terms of casino operations. The club has a deal with Codere, one of the largest casino operators in Spain, which means that Villarreal fans can enjoy gaming facilities at the El Madrigal stadium.

This is a big coup for Codere, as it is their first partnership with a major football club. The agreement will see Codere set up a 2,000 square metre casino within the stadium, which will offer a range of games including slots, roulette and blackjack. There will also be a bar and restaurant on site to cater for fans.

The launch of the casino was a big success, with over 1,500 people attending the opening day. This is a clear indication that there is high demand for gambling facilities at football stadiums, and it is likely that more clubs will follow Villarreal's lead in the near future.

This is great news for fans of Spanish football, as it means they can now enjoy a casino experience while watching their team play. It also gives Codere a competitive edge over other casino operators in Spain, as they are the only company offering this type of service.

#  Villarreal CF making a killing from casino profits!

Villarreal CF are one of La Liga's most successful clubs, having enjoyed a number of campaigns in the Spanish top division and also reaching the final of the Europa League in 2005. Their success has not come about by accident, as they have been very shrewd in their business dealings, including making a fortune from casino profits!

The club was founded in 1923 as Villarreal CD, with the team playing its home matches at the Campo de Fútbol Municipal stadium. However, it was not until 1998 that they made their first appearance in La Liga, with promotion coming via a play-off victory over Albacete Balompié. The following season saw them reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, before they eventually lost out to Spanish giants Valencia CF.

After several seasons of consolidation in La Liga, Villarreal reached new heights in 2005 when they reached the Europa League final. Unfortunately for them, they were beaten 3-0 by English side Liverpool FC. The club has also enjoyed relative success in La Liga during recent years, finishing 4th in 2007/2008 and 6th in 2009/2010.

One of the main reasons for their on-pitch success has been their shrewd business dealings off it. This was highlighted back in 2002 when they sold striker Diego Forlán to Manchester United for $28 million, making a tidy profit on the player who had only cost them $4 million just two years earlier!

More recently, the club has made a fortune from casino profits. In 2010 they announced a deal with Grupo Puleva whereby the food company would become the main sponsor of Villarreal CF in exchange for a percentage of casino profits. The deal is reported to be worth around €15 million per season and has been a huge success for both parties involved.

Villarreal CF have clearly been one of Spain's shrewdest clubs when it comes to business dealings and their shrewdness looks set to continue into the future. With their excellent track record in Europe and ability to make a killing from casino profits, there is no doubt that they will continue to be one of La Liga's biggest sides for many years to come!
