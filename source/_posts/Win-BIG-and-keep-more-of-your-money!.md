#  How to gambling and not pay taxes

Gambling in the United States can be a fun and profitable pastime, but it’s important to understand the tax implications before you start gambling. Gambling income is taxable, and the IRS expects taxpayers to report their gambling winnings on their tax returns.

Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to minimize your taxes on gambling income. Here are four tips for reducing your tax liability on gambling winnings:

1. Report Your Winnings

The first step in reducing your taxes on gambling income is to accurately report all of your winnings on your tax return. This includes both winning bets and jackpots. Reporting your winnings is the most important step in minimizing your tax liability, so make sure to keep accurate records of all of your gambling activity.

2. Claim Gambling Losses as well

In addition to reporting your winnings, you can also claim any gambling losses as a deduction on your tax return. This will help offset any taxes you owe on your gambling income. To claim gambling losses, you need to keep track of how much you lose overall each year. You can then deduct this amount from your total gambling income when filing your taxes.

3. Use a Tax professional

If you’re not comfortable doing your own taxes, consider hiring a tax professional to help you minimize your liability. A good tax preparer will know how to properly report your gambling income and deductions, ensuring that you pay the least amount of taxes possible.

4. Deduct Casino Travel Costs

Another potential deduction for gamblers is casino travel costs. If you travel specifically to gamble at a casino, you may be able to deduct those costs from your taxable income. This includes airfare, hotel expenses, and other related costs. Make sure to keep accurate records of these costs if you plan to claim them as a deduction.

#  Gambling and taxes: the loophole you need to know about

When it comes to gambling, most people think of casinos and lotteries. However, there are many other types of gambling, including betting on sports or trading stocks.

No matter what form it takes, gambling is always a risky proposition. You might win big, but you might also lose everything you’ve put in.

Gambling is also a tax-free activity. That may be about to change, however. The Australian government is considering introducing a new tax on gambling profits.

The proposed tax would apply to all forms of gambling, including online betting and casino games. It would be levied at a rate of 10%.

The main reason for the proposed tax is to help recover some of the billions of dollars lost each year to gambling-related problems. The government estimates that the new tax would raise around $300 million per year.

There has been strong opposition to the proposed tax from the gambling industry and others who argue that it will drive business offshore. They also argue that it will hit low and middle income earners the hardest.

Those opposed to the tax have until 20 September 2017 to make their submissions to the government’s consultation process.
