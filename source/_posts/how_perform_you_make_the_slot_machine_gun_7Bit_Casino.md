# How to Make a Slot Machine Gun

If you're a fan of slot machines and guns, then you might be interested in making your own slot machine gun. Although this may sound like a dangerous proposition, it can actually be a fun and safe way to combine two of your favorite hobbies. In this article, we will guide you through the steps on how to make a slot machine gun.

## Materials

- PVC pipe (1 inch diameter and 6 inches long)
- End caps for PVC pipe
- Rubber bands
- Paper clips
- Scissors
- Tape
- Paint (optional)
- Drill (optional)

## Steps

1. First, cut a slot in the PVC pipe that is wide enough to accommodate a quarter or similar sized object. This slot should be about 1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long.

2. Once you have the slot cut, drill a small hole in the center of the pipe just above the slot. This hole should be big enough to fit a paper clip.

3. Next, attach the end caps to each end of the PVC pipe.

4. Now, take a rubber band and loop it around the pipe so that it crosses over the slot. This rubber band will act as the trigger for the slot machine gun.

5. Take another rubber band and loop it around the pipe at the opposite end of the slot. This rubber band will be used to hold the quarters or other small objects in place.

6. Take a paper clip and bend it into a "U" shape. Insert one end of the paper clip into the small hole you drilled in step 2 and then loop the other end around the rubber band that is acting as the trigger.

7. Load the slot machine gun with quarters or similar sized objects by placing them in the slot and then pulling back on the rubber band that is holding them in place.

8. Aim the slot machine gun at your target and then release the paper clip trigger to fire the quarters.

9. If desired, you can paint your slot machine gun to give it a unique look.

## Safety Tips

It is important to note that slot machine guns can be dangerous if not used properly. Always wear eye protection when firing the gun and make sure that there are no people or animals in the immediate area. Additionally, do not fire the gun at any surfaces that could be damaged, such as walls or furniture.

In conclusion, making a slot machine gun can be a fun and unique project for those interested in slot machines and guns. By following these steps and using proper safety precautions, you can create your own slot machine gun to enjoy with friends and family.
